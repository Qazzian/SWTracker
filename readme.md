# Slimming World Syn Tracker

This is a simple web app to help you track your daily Syns and healthy options.


## Development Requirements

To build this from source you will first need to download and install the following dependencies:
- [node and npm](http://nodejs.org)
- grunt-cli
	`npm install -g grunt-cli`
- ruby
- ruby gem
- ruby bundler


## Building from source

1. install the dependancies (above)
1. Clone the git repository on to your machine
1. Move into the project root (`cd SWTracker` if you use GIT's suggested default directory)
1. run `npm install`
    - This will download all required node modules for development, trigger an install of the required Ruby libraries defined in Gemfile.lock and then run the default grunt task.
